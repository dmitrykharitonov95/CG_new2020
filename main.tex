\section*{Abstract}
As it is well-known, a problem of the optical frequency conversion \textcolor{red}{ attracts a permanent attention of researchers because of wide application of this phenomenon. In particular, the effective third harmonic generation (THG) is achieved by using  consecutive generation of  the second harmonic generation (SHG) and a wave with the sum frequency in two crystals with the quadratic nonlinear response.  The trebled frequency of high intensive laser pulse can be generated  in a medium with a cubic nonlinear response. However, the frequency conversion achievable efficiency is low essentially in this case.}



\textcolor{red}{
Another process, accompanying appearance of the pulse (or beam) self-action, is the cascading SHG.  This phenomenon have been investigated early both theoretically and experimentally. Below we demonstrate that the cascading SHG leads also to appearance of the effective (induced) cubic nonlinear response in a medium with the quadratic susceptibility. Based on multi-scale method, the modified equations describing frequency tripling process are derived from a set of the    Schr\"{o}dinger equations describing three-waves interaction with the frequencies \(\omega,\,2\omega,\,3\omega\).  The obtained equations are solved analytically in the frame-works of long pulse  duration approximation and plane wave approximation without using the basic wave  energy non-depletion approximation.}

\section{Introduction}
The cascaded \(\chi^{(2)}\) nonlinear phenomenon remains of interest for many years due to its various practical applications. For the first time, this phenomena has been theoretically predicted in 1974 by A.P. Sukhorukov and Yu.N. Karamzin \cite{bib:n1}. Since 1991 there is a permanent unterest to this phenomenon. So, in 1994, a physical experiment was made by a group of Torruellas \cite{bib:n2}. Then, many researchers have predicted and observed various types of cascading \(\chi^{(2)}\) solitons, in particular, 1D spatial \(\chi^{(2)}\) solitons \cite{bib:n3}, and 2D spatial \(\chi^{(2)}\) solitons \cite{bib:n2, bib:n4, bib:n5}, and \(\chi^{(2)}\) temporal solitons \cite{bib:n6}, and spatio-temporal solitons\cite{bib:n7} and others \cite{bib:n9,bib:n10}. Paper \cite{bib:n8}, for example, contains the comprehensive review of observing the cascading \(\chi^{(2)}\) solitons and their practical applications. 

One of the cascading SHG applications is the soliton compression \cite{bib:n11, bib:n12, bib:n13, bib:n14, bib:n15, bib:n16, bib:n17, bib:n18}. By choosing the appropriate sign of the phase mismatching, the pulse compression at the fundamental frequency (FF) can be reached. This phenomenon is also of interest nowadays. So, in \cite{bib:n11}, a soliton compression factor about of \(173.52\) is achieved. M. Bache and F.W. Wise have discussed in \cite{bib:n12} the soliton compression at the wavelength \(1030\,nm\) in a LiNbO$_3$ crystal, which length being equal to \(10\,cm\). In \cite{bib:n13} the pulse compression is obtained at the incident pulse with peak power density \(20\,GW/cm^2\). In \cite{bib:n14} such a pulse compression is observed BBO crystal with its length about of \(3\,cm\). 

Big phase mismatching between \textcolor{red}{  waves at the FF and the doubled frequency} may lead to self-focusing or defocusing of the beam at the FF, as it was shown in \cite{bib:n19}. In the axial-symmetric case, the beam intensity may be increased about 70 times \cite{bib:n20}. Another important application of the cascading SHG is its using for \textcolor{red}{  suppressing random fluctuations of both durations and  maximal power densities of pulses generated by  laser operating in the so-called free-generation mode \cite{bib:n21,bib:n22,bib:n23a,bib:n23}  because a frequency conversion of these sub-pulses possesses a low efficiency arising from fluctuations of their maximal intensity. We stress that only about \(2\%-3\%\) of the incident energy is lost  at suppressing those fluctuations.}

\textcolor{red}{Thus, observing phenomena inherent in  the Kerr effect, in a medium with the quadratic susceptibility in the case of a realization of the cascading SHG  was in many papers. However, all authors mentioned above have taken into account the phase self-modulation only for the laser pulse at the FF.
However, cascading SHG induces a response similar cubic susceptibility and it may  lead to THG if the corresponding phase matching occurs. Indeed, let us suppose that the incident fundamental wave intensity is high enough for manifesting the quadratic nonlinear response of a medium but not remarkable for manifesting of effects corresponding to the third-order susceptibility. At a big phase mismatching between waves with the doubled frequency and FF, the SH intensity remains low, but  THG (\(\omega_3=3\omega\)) may be observed if the phase matching between fundamental wave (FW) and a wave at trebled frequency occurs.
To analyse and understand the properties of THG  we firstly state the problem of three-wave interaction with the frequencies \(\omega,\,2\omega,\,3\omega \)  and then derive the modified equations, describing the frequency tripling process by using the multi-scale method (see, for example, \cite{bib:n24}) similar to that presented in \cite{bib:n19}. These   equations contain  terms  (the induced cubic nonlinear response) responsible for THG. The theoretical results are confirmed by computer simulation results obtained using a full set of Schr\"{o}dinger equations describing three-wave interaction with these frequencies. They show that the modified equations approximate the original ones with high precision.}

To evaluate the proposed method of the frequency trebling, it is necessary to discuss available  well-known modern schemes of the THG. There are some ways for achieving  high efficient THG. The most common way consists in a scheme with two nonlinear crystals. The first one is used for the phase-matched SHG, and the second one -  for a phase-matched sum frequency wave generation (SFG).\textcolor{red}{   Как заводится излучение основной волны во второй кристал? Импульс или пучок? Нужно везде напиать параметры.Я это уже говорил.  }.The conversion efficiency in physical experiments achieves  $80\%$ \cite{bib:t4a,bib:t4}.   High-efficient THG can also be achieved in a single crystal.  The FW pulse with duration  $40\,ps$ and a beam  diameter $10\,mm$ falls on the nonlinear crystal, in which the SH is generated. The BW energy is changed  from $0.5$ to $4.5\,mJ$. Then, a quarter-wave plate is used for changing SH wave polarization: this is necessary for achieving  phase matching at SFG process. After that, the  FW and SH waves are reflected by the mirror and pass the same crystal, in which THG occurs.   \textcolor{red}{Отражается тот же импульс основной волны или другой? Непонятно. Сколько преобразуется во вторую гармонику? Какие размеры кристалла? }. We stress that the beam with enough big diameter is used in this experiment to avoid an influence of its diffraction.  THG is realized also in a single BBO crystal with combined (quadratic and cubic) nonlinear response \textcolor{red}{приведите параметры} \cite{bib:t1}. Another technique of the trebled frequency  generation is based on using Quasi-Periodic Optical Superlattice (QPOS) \cite{bib:t2}.   The maximum frequency conversion achievable in this generation schemes is about $30\%$-$40\%$.

The advantages of approach, proposed below, are, in particular, the following. First, only one nonlinear crystal is required for effective frequency tripling and in contrast to \cite{bib:t4}, the changing  electric field polarization at the SH wave is not required because the phase matching between TH and FW is required only. The SH intensity is very low (about $2\%$ - $3\%$ or less that is comparable with losses at the mirror used in \cite{bib:t4a,bib:t4}) and the FW energy converts mostly to TH one. Secondly, the frequency conversion scheme under consideration can be applied directly for femtosecond pulses without a synchronization between  FW and SH  in contrast to \cite{bib:t5}, where a time pre-delayer was used to compensate the group velocity mismatching (GVM) between FW and SH. Thirdly, the high efficiency THG can be observed even for rather low intensity (about \(1\,GW/cm^2\) and low) of the incident pulse at FF with big duration: picosecond or  nanosecond or  even microsecond duration to minimize an  influence of the GVM  and the second-order dispersion (SOD) on the frequency up-conversion because the induced cubic susceptibility is much greater than the own susceptibility of the third order.
Fourthly, the frequency conversion based on cascading SHG accompanies by cross- and self-modulation of the TH wave and this leads to broadening of its spectrum. Obviously, it is very important for practice because it leads to possibility of additional compressing of the pulse. On the other hand, the terms responsible for the pulse compression differs in favorable way in comparison with THG in a medium with own third order susceptibility. 
Fifthly,  frequency trebling developing scheme can be applied for a medium possessing quadratic and cubic nonlinear response and it allows us to compensate partly a negative influence of the self- and cross-modulation caused by own third order susceptibility. 

\textcolor{red}{ Опишите структуру статьи, где и что исследовано  получено.}.

Цe provide another computer simulation results of frequency tripling. Highly intensive THG is achieved for both positive and negative phase mismatching between SH and FW. At the negative sign of the phase mismatching, the MI may appear, and as a result of this, a dramatic decreasing of the THG efficiency occurs. Nevertheless, at the beginning stage of the MI, a regular sequence of very short sub-pulses with self-similar shapes may appear.

\section{PROBLEM STATEMENT}

To clarify our scheme of the frequency trebling let us consider the following frequency conversion processes, depicted schematically in Fig. \ref{fr:match} for a crystal with quadratic (\(\chi^{(2)}\)) and cubic (\(\chi^{(3)}\))  susceptibilities. \textcolor{red}{A}  symbol \(\omega\) denotes  the FW frequency. 
Thus, we consider three processes \textcolor{red}{producing a wave with trebled frequency.} 

First process is a generation of an optical wave with doubled frequency (\(\omega+\omega=2\omega,\,\chi^{(2)}\)), and simultaneously THG based on the SFG (\(\omega+2\omega=3\omega,\,\chi^{(2)}\)) due to quadraic non-linear response of a crystal. The second one is directly the trebled frequency wave generation \(\chi^{(3)}_{cas}\) \textcolor{red}{ due to cubic non-linearity of a crystal. In comparison with the frequency doubling process this process requires  more intensive  incident pulse }. The third (new) process of the frequency tripling is based on the frequency doubling at big mismatching, \textcolor{red}{and this process can occur at low intensity of the incident wave in comparison of those occurring at own cubic non-linearity of a crystal}. This process is denoted as \(\omega\rightarrow3\omega\) with symbol \(\chi^{(3)}_{cas}\).   In Fig. \ref{fr:match} we also depict another frequency conversion processes (\(3\omega=2\omega+2\omega-\omega,\,\chi^{(3)}\)), which is taken into account by us. \textcolor{red}{Each of these frequency conversion processes is accompanied by own phase matching and own value of crystal susceptibility at the corresponding frequencies.Therefore, the susceptibilities \(\chi^{(3)}\) and  \(\chi^{(3)}_{cas}\) are different.} As a rule, only one of various conversion processes can occur at phase matching: in Fig. \ref{fr:match} this process is THG ($\chi^{(3)}$).
\begin{figure}[h!]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{Matching2}
\caption{Scheme of the phase matching and mismatching for various processes of frequency conversion.}
\label{fr:match}
\end{figure}
We suppose that the angle range for achieving the phase matching of the corresponding generation process is small enough to avoid its overlapping with phase matching angle range of other processes. In this case, it is possible to differ the process of THG, which occurs due to the SFG process, and due to the cascading SHG.

Starting from \textcolor{red}{the} Maxwell's equations,  one can derived the following set of dimensionless Schr\"{o}dinger equations with respect to slowly varying envelopes of the wave packets:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ref1}
\begin{aligned}
&L_jA_j+i\frac{\partial F}{\partial A_j^*}+iF_{selj}(A_1,\,A_2,\,A_3)=0,\,0< z \leq L_z , 0<t<L_t,\\
&L_j=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}+\nu_{j1}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+iD_j\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2},\\
&F=\gamma_1({A_1^*}^2A_2e^{-i\Delta_{21} kz}+A_1^2A_2^*e^{i\Delta_{21} kz})+\gamma_2 (A_1^*A_2^* A_3e^{-i(\Delta_{31}k-\Delta_{21}k)z}\\
+&A_1A_2A_3^*e^{i(\Delta_{31}k-\Delta_{21}k)z})+\alpha_1({A_1^*}^3 A_3 e^{-i\Delta_{31}kz}+A_1^3 A_3^* e^{i\Delta_{31}kz})\\
+&\alpha_2(A_1^*A_2^2 A_3^*e^{-i(2\Delta_{21}k-\Delta_{31}k )z}+A_1{A_2^*}^2 A_3e^{i(2\Delta_{21}k-\Delta_{31}k )z}),\\
&F_{selj}=j\alpha_3 A_j(2\sum\limits_{k=1}^3 |A_k|^2-|A_j|^2), j=1,\,2,\,3, \nu_{11}=0,\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which describes the optical frequency tripling in a medium with combined nonlinear response in the frame-work of the plane wave approximation (without taking into account a laser beam diffraction). 
Here \(A_1,\,A_2\) and \(A_3\) are the complex amplitudes of waves with the basic frequency (\(\omega\)), and the doubled frequency (\(2\omega\)), and the tripled frequency (\(3\omega\)), respectively, normalized at \(A_{01}=\sqrt{I_{01}}\) (a square root of the \textcolor{red}{ incident pulse maximal intensity} at the FF). Parameter \(\gamma_j\) is the interacting waves coupling coefficient  due to the quadratic non-linear response at the corresponding frequencies. \textcolor{red}{ In general case, this coefficient may be different for various generation processes. However, for simplicity, we choose the same value (\(\gamma_j=\gamma\)) for all these processes involving in equations \eqref{eq:ref1}. Parameters \(\alpha_j\) depend on frequencies and characterize the cubic non-linear response of a medium responsible  for self-  and cross-modulation of the interacting waves as well as  the THG process.} 

\textcolor{red}{Далее некоторый кусок не  исправлен}

Further, for simplicity, we will suppose that all coefficients \(\alpha_j\) are also the same: \(\alpha_j=\alpha\). Parameter \(\Delta_{21} k=k_2 - 2k_1\)  characterizes the phase mismatching on the length $Z_n=1\,mm$, in which units a longitudinal coordinate $z$ is measured at the SHG. \(k_1\) and \(k_2\) denote dimensionless wavenumbers for waves with the FF and doubled frequency. Parameter \(\Delta_{31} k=k_3 - 3k_1\) characterizes the phase mismatching on $Z_n$ at THG. \(k_3\) denotes dimensionless TH wavenumber. Coordinate \(t\) is a time, measured in units of the pulse duration \(\tau_P\) at the FF. Parameters \(\nu_{21}\) and \(\nu_{31}\) characterize dimensionless GVM between SH and FW, and TH and FW, respectively. Parameters \(D_{j}, j=1,2,3\) characterize dimensionless SOD of the corresponding wave packet. Parameters \(L_t\) and \(L_z\) define the time interval, during which the laser pulse interaction is analyzed, and the maximal distance of the pulse propagation, respectively.

The initial distributions of the complex amplitudes are the following:
\begin{equation}\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:first}
&A_1(0,t)=A_{10}(t),\, A_2(0,t)=0,\,A_3(0,t)=0,\, t\in[0,L_t],\\
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
and corresponds to a finite distribution of the laser pulses.

Let us discuss the terms in the set of the equations \eqref{eq:ref1}. The term \(\gamma_1 A_1^2e^{i\Delta_{21} kz}\) (\(\chi^{(2)}(2\omega;\,\omega,\omega\))) in the second equation corresponds to the generation of a wave with doubled frequency for the process (\(\omega+\omega\rightarrow2\omega\)). The term \(\gamma_1  A_1^* A_2e^{-i\Delta_{21} kz}\) in the first equation is responsible for the opposite process (\(2\omega \rightarrow \omega+\omega\)). The term \(\alpha_1 A_1^3e^{i\Delta_{31}kz}\) (\(\chi^{(3)}(3\omega;\,\omega,\omega,\omega\))) in the third equation corresponds to THG due to cubic nonlinear response, and the term \(\alpha_1 {A_1^*}^2 A_3 e^{-i\Delta_{31}kz}\) in the first equation corresponds to the opposite process (\(3\omega\rightarrow\omega+\omega+\omega\)). A process of the THG via the SFG is described by the term \(\gamma_2 A_1 A_2e^{i(\Delta_{31}k-\Delta_{21}k)z}\) (\(\chi^{(2)}(3\omega;\,\omega,2\omega\))) in the third equation. The term \(\gamma_2 A_2^* A_3e^{-i(\Delta_{31}k-\Delta_{21}k)z}\) in the first equation the term \(\gamma A_1^* A_3e^{-i(\Delta_{31}k-\Delta_{21}k)z}\) in the second equation correspond to the reverse processes (\(3\omega\rightarrow2\omega+\omega\)). The phase mismatching for this process (denoted as \(\Delta_{SFG}k\)) is expressed through the phase mismatching of SHG and THG processes: \(\Delta_{SFG}k=\Delta_{31}k-\Delta_{21}k\). The terms \(\alpha_3 A_j|A_j|^2, j=1,\,2,\,3\) and \(\alpha_3 A_j|A_k|^2,\,j=1,2,3,\,k=1,2,3,j\ne k\) are responsible for the self- and the cross-modulation of waves, respectively. SHG via the process (\(3\omega+\omega\rightarrow2\omega+2\omega\)) corresponds to the term \(\alpha_2 A_1A_2^*A_3e^{i(2\Delta_{21}k-\Delta_{31}k )z}\) (\(\chi^{(3)}(2\omega;\,\omega,3\omega,-2\omega\))) in the second equation, and the term \(\alpha_2 A_2^2 A_3^*e^{-i(2\Delta_{21}k-\Delta_{31}k )z}\) in the first equation and the term \(\alpha_2 A_1^* A_2^2 e^{-i(2\Delta_{21}k-\Delta_{31}k )z}\) in the third equation correspond to the opposite process (\(2\omega+2\omega\rightarrow3\omega+\omega\)). In this case, the phase mismatching is the following: \(\Delta_{WM}k=2\Delta_{21}k-\Delta_{31}k\).

 Let us note that the introduced dimensionless parameters and functions are expressed through the physical ones, denoted with containing line above them, with accordance to a rule:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:pars}
\begin{aligned}
&A_j=\frac{\bar{A}_j}{\sqrt{I_{01}}},\,D_j=-\frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 \bar{k}}{\partial \bar{\omega}^2}\Big|_{\bar{\omega}_j}\frac{Z_n}{\tau_P^2},\omega_j=\bar{\omega}_j\tau_P,\,j=1,2,3,\,t=\frac{\bar{t}}{\tau_P},\,z=\frac{\bar{z}}{Z_n},\\
&\nu_{j1}=\left(\frac{\partial \bar{k}}{\partial \bar{\omega}}\Big|_{j\bar{\omega}}-\frac{\partial \bar{k}}{\partial \bar{\omega}}\Big|_{\bar{\omega}}\right)\frac{Z_n}{\tau_P},\,\Delta_{j1}k=\Delta_{j1}\bar{k}Z_n,\,j=2,\,3\\
&\gamma=\frac{2\pi\chi^{(2)}\bar{k}\sqrt{I_{01}}}{n^2}Z_n,\,\alpha=\frac{3\pi \bar{k}}{2n^2}\chi^{(3)}I_{01} Z_n,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$n$ is a refractive index with FF. For computer simulation we choose the following values of the physical parameters: \(\tau_P \text{ is changed from } 100fs\text{ to }10ps,\) the wavelength corresponding to wave with FF is equal to \(\lambda_1=1064\,nm\) or \(\lambda_1=800\,nm\). 

In Table \ref{tab:1}, we show some characteristics of various crystals at the frequencies corresponding to the frequency conversion processes under consideration. First of all, we write the angle \(\theta\) of the phase matching for the THG due to the cubic nonlinear response of a medium (the second row in Table \ref{tab:2}). The first and second derivatives of wave number with respect to the frequency are presented at the frequencies \(\omega,\, 2\omega\) and \(3\omega\). All data are computed using so-called Sellmeier equations, and they coincide with values, presented in \cite{bib:ri}. We also place the references to the papers, which contain the data, after the names of the crystals. 

The second order susceptibility of selected crystals with dependent on the angles \(\theta\) and \(\varphi\), and the incident pulse intensity, at which the coupling coefficient \(\gamma\) is equal to unity at the phase matching angle \(\theta\) (see Table \ref{tab:1}), are shown in Table \ref{tab:2}. The angles are measured between the crystal axis in the uniaxial crystal and wave vector of the FW.

The frequency conversion efficiency is estimated as:
\begin{equation}
\eta_j(z)=\frac{\int\limits_0^{L_t}|A_j(z,t)|^2dt}{\int\limits_0^{L_t}|A_1(z=0,t)|^2dt}.
\end{equation}
Another characteristic, which describes the frequency conversion process is the pulse spectra. They are computed by the formula
\begin{equation}
\hat{A}_j^\omega(z;\omega)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int\limits_{0}^{L_t} A_j(z,t)e^{-i\omega t}dt,\,j=1,\,2,\,3
\end{equation}
using the NumPy module \cite{bib:np} of Python Language. We also use the pulse full width at half maximum of intensity (FWHM):
\[\tau_j(z)=T_2-T_1,\, |A_j(z,T_l)|^2=0.5|A_j(z,0.5L_t)|^2,\,l=1,\,2,\,T_1<0.5L_t<T_2.\]
 and the corresponding value for spectrum FWHM. Thus, the incident pulse FWHM equals \(1.1772\), and the incident pulse spectrum FWHM equals \(2.357\).

\section{Induced cubic non-linear response based on cascading SHG}

\subsection{Derivation of the \textcolor{red}{modified } equations}

For demonstrating  appearance of the  induced cubic susceptibility of a medium due to cascading SHG, we use the multi-scale method \cite{bib:n24}, which was early applied in \cite{bib:n19} for demonstration of observing induced non-linearity similar Kerr effect and responsible for the pulse self-compression or its decompression  because of the  process under considerationю
With this aim we consider a case \(\alpha=0\), which corresponds to omitting the terms with cubic nonlinear response in \eqref{eq:ref1},  and \(\Delta_{31}k=0\), which corresponds to the phase matching between the incident wave and the wave with trebled frequency. Because we consider a big phase mismatching between SH and FW: \(|\Delta_{21}k|>>1\), then the process of wave interaction possesses various space scales: in particular, a small scale, defined by big phase mismatching \(|\Delta_{21}k|\), and a long space scale defined by the dispersion lengths of the interacting pulses. 

For simplicity of  analysis at deriving equations describing THG, let's make a substitution of TH complex amplitude as follows:
$$
{A}_3=\bar{A}_3e^{i\Delta_{31}kz}
$$
(for brevity, the bar is omitted below ). The equation set \eqref{eq:ref1} is transformed to the form
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:refg}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial{A_1}}{\partial{z}}+iD_1\frac{\partial^2{A_1}}{\partial{t^2}}+i\gamma\left(A_1^* A_2e^{-i\Delta_{21} kz}+A_2^* A_3e^{i\Delta_{21}kz}\right)=0,\\
&\frac{\partial{A_2}}{\partial{z}}+\nu_{21}\frac{\partial A_2}{\partial t}+iD_2\frac{\partial^2{A_2}}{\partial{t^2}}+i\gamma\left(A_1^2e^{i\Delta_{21} kz}+2A_1^*A_3e^{i\Delta_{21}kz}\right)=0,\\
&\frac{\partial{A_3}}{\partial{z}}+\nu_{31}\frac{\partial A_3}{\partial t}+iD_3\frac{\partial^2{A_3}}{\partial{t^2}}+3i\gamma A_1 A_2e^{-i\Delta_{21}kz}+i\Delta_{31}kA_3=0,\,0< z \leq L_z , 0<t<L_t.\\
\end{aligned}\end{equation}
\textcolor{red}{As follows from the set of equations \eqref{eq:refg} we take into account the three-waves interaction with equidistant frequencies in contrast to the well-known case of cascading SHG , at which the wave with trebled frequency is not considered. This is a main difference between current study and other papers referring to the problem of cascading SHG. }

Then let's introduce a small parameter \(\mu=\frac{1}{\Delta_{21}k}\) (for simplicity, we suppose that the phase mismatching has a positive sign) and introduce various scales along \(z\) coordinate: small scale equal to the inverse phase mismatching length: \(\xi=\frac{z}{\mu}\), and big longitudinal scales \(z_l=\mu^lz,\,l=0,1,2...\). Because of the big absolute value of the phase mismatching, the SHG efficiency is very low. Therefore, the complex amplitudes are expanded in a power series of \(\mu\):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp}
\begin{aligned}
&A_1=U+\mu U_1 +\mu^2 U_2 +...,\\
&A_2=V+\mu V_1 + \mu^2 V_2 +...,\\
&A_3=W+\mu W_1 + \mu^2 W_2+....\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Obviously, the functions in \eqref{eq:exp} depend on all the variables \((t,\xi,z_l|l\ge0)\), and
the differential operators in terms of new variables take a form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:op}
\begin{aligned}
L_j&=\frac{\partial}{\partial z}+\nu_{j1}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+iD_j\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}=\frac{\partial \xi}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi}+\sum\limits_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{\partial z_l}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_l}+iD_j\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}=\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi}+\sum\limits_{l=0}^{\infty} \mu^l\frac{\partial}{\partial z_l}+iD_j\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}\\
&=\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi}+L_j^{0}+\mu\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1}+\mu^2 \frac{\partial}{\partial z_2}+...,j=1,2,3.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here, operator \(L_j\) is defined as 
\[L_j^{(0)}=\frac{\partial}{\partial z_0}+\nu_{j1}\frac{\partial}{\partial t}+ iD_j\frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}.\]

Then, substituting expansion \eqref{eq:exp} into the equation set \eqref{eq:refg} and collect terms, which are less than \(\mu^2\), we obtain the equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:allset}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial U}{\partial \xi}+L_1^{(0)}U+\mu \frac{\partial U}{\partial z_1}+\frac{\partial U_1}{\partial\xi}+\mu L_1^{(0)}U_1+\mu\frac{\partial U_2}{\partial \xi}+\\
+&i\gamma\left(U^*Ve^{-i\xi}+V^*We^{i\xi}+\mu((U^*V_1+U_1^*V)e^{-i\xi}+(V^*W_1+V_1^*W)e^{i\xi})\right)+O(\mu^2)=0,\\
&\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}+L_2^{(0)}V+\mu \frac{\partial V}{\partial z_1}+\frac{\partial V_1}{\partial\xi}+\mu L_1^{(0)}V_1+\mu\frac{\partial V_2}{\partial \xi}+\\
+&i\gamma\left(U^2e^{i\xi}+2U^*We^{i\xi}+\mu(2UU_1e^{i\xi}+(U^*W_1+U_1^*W)e^{i\xi})\right)+O(\mu^2)=0,\\
&\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial W}{\partial \xi}+L_3^{(0)}W+\mu \frac{\partial W}{\partial z_1}+\frac{\partial W_1}{\partial\xi}+\mu L_1^{(0)}W_1+\mu\frac{\partial W_2}{\partial \xi}+\\
+&3i\gamma \left(UVe^{-i\xi}+\mu(UV_1+U_1V)e^{-i\xi}\right)+i\Delta_{31}k(W+\mu W_1)+O(\mu^2)=0.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The terms with respect to power of \(\frac{1}{\mu}\) allow us to write the equations:
\[\frac{\partial U}{\partial \xi}=\frac{\partial V}{\partial \xi}=\frac{\partial W}{\partial \xi}=0.\]
 Consequently, the functions \(U,\,V\) and \(W\) do not depend on fast changing coordinate \(\xi\), and they do not change at the small scale.

Next order \(O(1)\) of power \(\mu\) leads to the following equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:fo}
\begin{aligned}
&L_1^{(0)}U+\frac{\partial U_1}{\partial\xi}+i\gamma(U^*Ve^{-i\xi}+V^*We^{i\xi})=0,\\
&L_2^{(0)}V+\frac{\partial V_1}{\partial \xi}+i\gamma(U^2e^{i\xi}+2U^*We^{i\xi})=0,\\
&L_3^{(0)}W+\frac{\partial W_1}{\partial \xi}+3i\gamma UVe^{-i\xi}+i\Delta_{31}kW=0.\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Because the first terms in these equations do not depend on \(\xi\) meanwhile other terms do depend on this variable, then one can separate equations into two parts. The first of them is written as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:m1}
L_1^{(0)}U=L_2^{(0)}V=L_3^{(0)}W+i\Delta_{31}kW=0.
\end{equation}
The functions \(U_1,\,V_1,\,W_1\) can be found from the other parts by integrating \eqref{eq:fo} with respect to \(\xi\):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ford}
\begin{aligned}
&U_1=\gamma(U^*Ve^{-i\xi}-V^*We^{i\xi})+u_1(t,z_0,\,z_1...),\\
&V_1=\gamma(-U^2e^{i\xi}-2U^*We^{i\xi})+v_1(t,z_0,\,z_1...),\\
&W_1=3\gamma UVe^{-i\xi}+w_1(t,z_0,\,z_1...).\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Here \(u_1, v_1, w_1\) are the function of integration: they do not depend on \(\xi\). The equations with respect these functions are written further.

The order \(O(\mu)\) of the power serious leads to the equations:
\[\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial U_2}{\partial \xi}+L_1^{(0)}U_1+\frac{\partial U}{\partial z_1}+i\gamma((U^*V_1+U_1^*V)e^{-i\xi}+(V^*W_1+V_1^*W)e^{i\xi})=0,\\
&\frac{\partial V_2}{\partial \xi}+L_2^{(0)}V_1+\frac{\partial V}{\partial z_1}+i\gamma(2UU_1e^{i\xi}+(U^*W_1+U_1^*W)e^{i\xi})=0,\\
&\frac{\partial W_2}{\partial \xi}+L_3^{(0)}W_1+\frac{\partial W}{\partial z_1}+3i\gamma(UV_1+U_1V)e^{-i\xi}+\Delta_{31}kW_1=0.\\
\end{aligned}\]

Using the representation \eqref{eq:ford}, this set transforms into the form:
\begin{small}
\[\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial U_2}{\partial \xi}+\gamma(L_1^{(0)}(U^*V)e^{-i\xi}-L_1^{(0)}(V^*W)e^{i\xi})+i\gamma^2(U^*v_1e^{-i\xi}-V^2W^*e^{-2i\xi}+u_1^*Ve^{-i\xi}+V^*w_1e^{i\xi}+v_1^*We^{i\xi})=\\
&-\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial z_1}+i\gamma^2(-|U|^2U-3U^{*2}W+4U|V|^2-2U|W|^2)\right)-L_1^{(0)}u_1,\\
&\frac{\partial V_2}{\partial \xi}-\gamma(L_2^{(0)}(U^2)e^{i\xi}+2L_2^{(0)}(U^*W)e^{i\xi})+i\gamma^2(-2UV^*We^{2i\xi}+2Uu_1e^{i\xi}+2UV^*We^{i\xi}+2u_1^*We^{i\xi}+2U^*we^{i\xi})=\\
&-\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial z_1}+2i\gamma^2(4|U|-|W|^2)V\right)-L_2^{(0)}v_1,\\
&\frac{\partial W_2}{\partial \xi}+3\gamma L_3^{(0)}(UV)e^{-i\xi}+3i\gamma^2(Uv_1e^{-i\xi}+U^*V^2*e^{-2i\xi}+u_1V_1e^{-i\xi})+3i\Delta_{31}k\gamma UVe^{-i\xi}=\\
&-\left(\frac{\partial W}{\partial z_1}-3i\gamma^2(U^3+2|U|^2W+|V|^2W)\right)-L_1^{(0)}w_1-i\Delta_{31}kw_1.\\
\end{aligned}\]
\end{small}
As above we can state that the right-hand sides of the equations must be equal to zero because they do not depend on \(\xi\) in contrast to the left-hand sides of the equations. Thus, we write the equations
\[\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial U}{\partial z_1}+i\gamma^2(-|U|^2U-3U^{*2}W+4U|V|^2-2U|W|^2)=-L_1^{(0)}u_1,\\
&\frac{\partial V}{\partial z_1}+2i\gamma^2(4|U|^2-|W|^2)V=L_2^{(0)}v_1,\\
&\frac{\partial W}{\partial z_1}-3i\gamma^2(U^3+2|U|^2W+|V|^2W)=L_3^{(0)}w_1+i\Delta_{31}kw_1.\\
\end{aligned}\]
Because the functions \(u_1,\,v_1,\,w_1\)  belong to order \(O(\mu)\) (see \eqref{eq:ford} ) meanwhile the functions \(U,\,V,\,W\) belong to order \(O(1)\), then we can once again separate the obtained equation into two parts: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:mai}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial U}{\partial z_1}+i\gamma^2(-|U|^2U-3U^{*2}W+4U|V|^2-2U|W|^2)=0,\\
&\frac{\partial V}{\partial z_1}+2i\gamma^2(4|U|^2-|W|^2)V=0,\\
&\frac{\partial W}{\partial z_1}-3i\gamma^2(U^3+2|U|^2W+|V|^2W)=0.\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
 Consequently, the equations
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&L_1^{(0)}u_1=0,\
&L_2^{(0)}v_1=0,\
&L_3^{(0)}w_1+i\Delta_{31}kw_1=0\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
are valid.

Finally, after returning to original variables (\(\xi=\Delta_{21}kz,\,z_0=z,\,z_1=z/\Delta_{21}k,\,\frac{\partial}{\partial z}=\Delta_{21}k\frac{\partial}{\partial \xi}+\frac{\partial}{\partial z_0}+\frac{1}{\Delta_{21}k}\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1}+O(\Delta_{21}k^{-2})\)), we obtain the following set of equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial U}{\partial z}+iD_1\frac{\partial^2 U}{\partial t^2}-i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(|U|^2U+3U^{*2}W-4U|V|^2+2U|W|^2)=0,\\
&\frac{\partial V}{\partial z}+\nu_{21}\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+iD_2\frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial t^2}+2i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(4|U|^2-|W|^2)V=0,\\
&\frac{\partial W}{\partial z}+\nu_{31}\frac{\partial W}{\partial t}+iD_3\frac{\partial^2 W}{\partial t^2}-3i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(U^3+2|U|^2W+|V|^2W)+i\Delta_{31}kW=0\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
with respect to \(U,V,W\), and the functions \(u_1,v_1,w_1\) are the solution of the linear Schr\"{o}dinger equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main_2}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{\partial u_1}{\partial z}+iD_1\frac{\partial^2 u_1}{\partial t^2}=0,\\
&\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial z}+\nu_{21}\frac{\partial v_1}{\partial t}+iD_2\frac{\partial^2 v_1}{\partial t^2}=0,\\
&\frac{\partial w_1}{\partial z}+\nu_{31}\frac{\partial w_1}{\partial t}+iD_3\frac{\partial^2 w_1}{\partial t^2}+i\Delta_{31}kw_1=0,\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
and the expansion series \eqref{eq:exp} transforms into the following form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp2}
\begin{aligned}
&A_1=U+\frac{1}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(\gamma(U^*Ve^{-i\Delta_{21}kz}-V^*We^{i\Delta_{21}kz})+u_1\right),\\
&A_2=V+\frac{1}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(-\gamma(U^2+2U^*W)e^{i\Delta_{21}kz}+v_1\right),\\
&A_3=W+\frac{1}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(3\gamma UVe^{-i\Delta_{21}kz}+w_1\right).\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Let's stress that without taking into account the wave with trebled frequency (\(A_3=W=w_1=0\)),  the equations \eqref{eq:main} -  \eqref{eq:exp2} reduce to the corresponding ones, derived in \cite{bib:n19}.

As we analyze the THG, then we believe that  the  SH and TH is absence in the input section of a medium. Therefore, the complex amplitudes \(A_2\) and \(A_3\) are equal to zero in this section. This results in the following conditions with respect to functions  \(U,\,V,\,W\):

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ini3}
U|_{z=0}=A_1|_{z=0}=A_{10}(t),\,
V|_{z=0}=A_2|_{z=0}=0,\,
W|_{z=0}=A_3|_{z=0}=0.
\end{equation}
and to functions \(u_1,\,v_1,\,w_1\):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ini4}
 u_1|_{z=0}=w_1|_{z=0}=0,\, v_1|_{z=0}=\gamma A_{10}^2(t),
\end{equation}
respectively. At writing these conditions we  compare the corresponding terms in a series with respect to the small parameter \((\Delta_{21}k)^{-1}\) in \eqref{eq:exp2}. Since the initial distributions of the complex amplitudes \(A_j,\,j=1,2,3\) do not contain the terms at \((\Delta_{21}k)^{-1}\), then the corresponding terms in \eqref{eq:exp2} should be chosen equal to zero. Then the equations sets \eqref{eq:main}, \eqref{eq:main_2} reduce to the following view:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:exp3}
\begin{aligned}
&A_1=U, A_2=\frac{1}{\Delta_{21}k}(-\gamma (U^2+2U^*W)e^{i\Delta_{21}kz}+v_1), A_3=W,\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
were functions \(U,\,W,\,v_1\) are governed by the set of nonlinear equations:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main2}
\begin{aligned}
&L_1U-i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(|U|^2U+3U^{*2}W+2U|W|^2)=0,\\
&L_3W-3i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(U^3+2|U|^2W)+i\Delta_{31}kW=0,\,L_2 v_1=0\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
because the SH amplitude \(V\) is equal to zero ( \(V\equiv0\) ) due to both its initial condition \eqref{eq:ini3} and its including  in all terms belonging to the second equation of the equations set \eqref{eq:main}. The same analysis shows that \(u_1\equiv0,\,w_1\equiv0\).
Thus, these equations are supplemented with the following initial conditions:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ini2}
U|_{z=0}=A_{10}(t),\,W|_{z=0}=0,\,v_1|_{z=0}=\gamma A_{10}^2(t).
\end{equation}
and zero-valued BCs because all pulses have finite initial distribution and we consider bounded domain in \(z\)-coordinate. We call below the problem \eqref{eq:main2}-\eqref{eq:ini2} as the modified problem.

The equations  \eqref{eq:main2} possess the energy conservation law: 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ninv1}
I_1=\int\limits_0^{L_t}\left(|U|^2+|W|^2\right)dt=const
\end{equation}
if the functions \(U,\,W\) are equal to zero at the time moments \(t=0,L_t\).  

The Hamiltonian of the equation set \eqref{eq:main2} is written in the form:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ninv3}
\begin{aligned}
I_3&=\int\limits_0^{L_t}\Big(2\nu_{31}Im\left(W^*\frac{\partial W}{\partial t}\right)-6D_1|\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}|^2-2D_3|\frac{\partial W}{\partial t}|^2-\\
&\frac{3\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(4Re(U^3W^*)+|U|^4+4|U|^2|W|^2\right)+2\Delta_{31}k|W|^2\Big)dt=const.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

We  emphasize that a value of the energy invariant \eqref{eq:ninv1} coincides with a value of  \eqref{eq:inv1} because these invariants are equal to \(\int\limits_0^{L_t}|A_{10}|^2dt\). However, because the invariant for the  set modified equations do not contain the SH wave, then the sum energy of two other waves will be greater than a sum of the energies of corresponding waves computed using the original problem.

\subsection{Equivalence   of the induced cubic susceptibility and  own susceptibility of a medium }
}


\textcolor{red} {To illustrate that we get the induced cubic susceptibility we show below two tests which confirm our approach. With this aim we depict in Fig. \ref{fr:f}a a dependence of both the TH intensity and the THG efficiency on the incident pulse maximal intensity at computing both in long pulse duration approximation (lines) and at accounting for the   SOD action    (circles and triangles, stars and squares) at using two set of the equations. In the first case, the pulses propagate in a medium with the quadratic susceptibility at phase mismatching \(\Delta_{21}k=20\) between SH and BW. In the second one, we consider THG (SH is absent) in a medium with the cubic susceptibility at the appropriate choice of the parameter \(\alpha\) being equal to \(3\gamma^2/\Delta_{21}k\). As it follows from the equations sets \eqref{eq:ref1},\eqref{eq:main}, such a choice of the parameter \(\alpha\) leads to the same coefficient at the term $A_1^3$ (or $U^3$) in both sets. Compairing computation results we see practically the same way of changing both the pulse intensity and the frequency conversion efficiency computed using both sets of equations.} 

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\centering

\label{fr:f}
\end{figure}

Another test refers to the computer simulation of frequency tripling in a medium with combined (quadratic and cubic) non-linearity at choosing parameter $\alpha$ equaling to $3\gamma^2/\Delta_{31}k$. According to theoretical analysis, the cubic nonlinear response of a medium and the induced cubic nonlinear will compensate action of each other for such choosing. As we see in Fig. \ref{fr:f}b, this occurs and the TH maximal intensity does not exceed $0.0006$. 

Thus, these results show clearly that the cascading SHG induces the cubic susceptibility. 


\subsection{Exact solution of the modified problem.}
In the framework of the long pulse duration approximation, the functions \(U,W\) depend only on \(z\) coordinate, and we can rewrite the problem \eqref{eq:main2},\eqref{eq:ini2} in the form:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main2l}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{dU}{dz}-i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(|U|^2U+3U^{*2}W+2U|W|^2)=0,\\
&\frac{dW}{dz}-3i\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21} k}(U^3+2|U|^2W)+\Delta_{31}kW=0,\,  0< z \leq L_z\\
&U(0)=1,\,W(0)=0.\\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
The invariants \eqref{eq:ninv1}, \eqref{eq:ninv3} are written as follows:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ninvs}
\begin{aligned}
&I_1=|U|^2+|W|^2,\\
&I_3=\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(-12Re(U^3W^*)-3|U|^4-12|U|^2|W|^2\right)+2\Delta_{31}k|W|^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We note that the first invariant of the problem \eqref{eq:main2l} equals unity (\(I_1=1\)) due to the initial conditions.

To write intensities evolution for the interacting waves, we use a well-known representation for the complex amplitudes:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:repr}
U(z)=a_1e^{i\varphi_1(z)},\,W(z)=a_3e^{i\varphi_3(z)},
\end{equation}
where \(a_j,\,\varphi_j\) are the real functions describing amplitudes and phases of the waves. In new notations, the equations \eqref{eq:main2l} are re-written:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main3}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{da_1}{dz}=-\frac{3\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}a_1^2a_3\sin\varphi,\\
&\frac{da_3}{dz}=\frac{3\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}a_1^3\sin\varphi,\\
&\frac{d\varphi}{dz}-\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(3\left(\frac{a_1^3}{a_3}-3a_1a_3\right)\cos\varphi+3a_1^2-6a_3^2\right)+\Delta_{31}k=0,
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
here \(\varphi=\varphi_3-3\varphi_1\) is a phase difference between TH and FW. The invariants  \eqref{eq:ninvs} are transformed to the following form:
\[
\begin{aligned}
&I_1=a_1^2+a_3^2=1,\\
&I_3=\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\left(-12a_1^3a_3\cos\varphi-3a_1^4-12a_1^2a_3^2\right)+\Delta_{31}ka_3^2.
\end{aligned}
\] 

To express \(\cos \varphi\) we modify the third invariant:
\[
\tilde{I}_3=I_3+3\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}I_1^2=-12\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}a_1^3a_3\cos\varphi+-6\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}a_1^2a_3^2+3\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}a_3^4+2\Delta_{31}ka_3^2=0,
\]
which equals zero because the TH incident intensity is equal to zero: \(a_3(0)=0\). Hence, we can express \(\cos \varphi\):
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:cos}
\cos\varphi=\frac{a_3(-6a_1^2+3a_3^2+2q)}{12a_1^3},
\end{equation}
where the parameter $q$ is defined as:
$$
q=\frac{\Delta_{21}k\Delta_{31}k}{\gamma^2},
$$
which characterizes relation between phase incursions because of phase mismatching between SH and BW, and TH and BW, respectively, and because of nonlinear coupling coefficient ${\gamma}$.
Obviously, an inequality 
\[
|\cos\varphi|\le1
\]
must be valid. This leads to restriction on the intensities changing.
Then we find \(\sin \varphi\) from the equality \eqref{eq:cos} and substitute it into the second equation of \eqref{eq:main3}, which is preliminary multiplied by \(a_1\). As a result, we write the following equation with respect to the TH intensity:
\[\frac{da_3^2}{dz}=\pm6\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}a_1^3a_3(\sqrt{1-\frac{a_3^2(-6a_1^2+3a_3^2+2q)^2}{36a_1^6}}.\]
Using the new variable \(p_3=a_3^2\) and expressing \(a_1^2\) from the first invariant \(a_1^2=1-p_3\), we finally obtain:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:main4}
\begin{aligned}
&\frac{dp_3}{dz}=\pm7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\sqrt{p_3f(p_3)},\\
&f(p_3)=\frac{16}{25}((1-p_3)^3-\frac{1}{144}p_3(9p_3+2q-6)^2).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Sign in the right side of the equation corresponds to different processes: sign ``plus" corresponds to a conversion of the BW energy to TH energy, and sign ``minus" to reverse energy conversion from the wave with trebled frequency to the FW. So, since TH incident intensity equals zero, then we choose the sign ``plus".

The intensity evolution is defined by the parameter $q$ because it defines the number of real roots of the equation
$$
f(p_3)=0,
$$
which can be found, for example, by using the Sturm theorem. We  denote them as
$P_{31},\,P_{32},\,P_{33}$, where $P_{31}$ is  real always. If two other roots are also real then we support that there is inequality:   $P_{31}\le P_{32}\le P_{33}$ between them. Obviously, this   \textcolor{red}{assumption} does not restrict our consideration.
It should be also stressed that a solution of the equation \eqref{eq:main4} is expressed through the elliptical functions or, in certain cases, through elementary functions. Below we briefly discuss the problem  solution corresponding to various values of the parameter $q$.
Moreover, we вdevelop also the TH phase evolution. Because of the complexity of the obtained formula we do not write it here. However, using the formulas with respect to the phase and the intensity, it is possible to approximate the solution of the problem \eqref{eq:ref1}-\eqref{eq:first} with good accuracy. We show it below using the computer simulation results.


\paragraph*{Domain  $q<-1.5,\,q>3 + \frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{2}}-9\sqrt[3]{ 2}$: two complex roots $P_{32},P_{33}$.}
Only the root $P_{31}$ is positive. As a result, the TH intensity  $p_3(z)$ changes between zero and $P_{31}$ with accordance of the following formula:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p1_1}
p_3(z)=|A_3(z)|^2=\frac{cP_{31}(1-cn(7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\kappa z,k))}{(d-c)cn(7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\kappa z,k)+(c+d)},
\end{equation}
where
$$
\begin{aligned}
&c=\sqrt{r^2+s^2},\, d=\sqrt{(p_{31}-r)^2+s^2}, \kappa=\sqrt{cd}, k=\frac{\kappa^2+(r+P_{31})r-s^2}{2\kappa^2},\\
&r=Re(P_{32}),\, s=Im (P_{32}).
\end{aligned}
$$
\textcolor{red}{исправьте обозначение корней выше. Просмотрите все и везде. Кое-где я поправил}. This domain of the parameter $q$ contains important case of THG corresponding to the phase matching between FW and TH ($\Delta_{31}k=0$). Under this condition there is only a unique branch of the TH intensity changing between \(0\) and $P_{31}=0.8$, and this value coincides with our estimation obtained above \textcolor{red}{где эта оценка??? Непонятно}. Other two roots are defined by a solution of the equation \(5p_3^2-8p_3+4=0\), and they are the complex ones (\(P_{31,\,32}=0.8\pm0.4i\)). 
As a result, the TH intensity evolution  is described by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:sol}
p_3(z)=\frac{4(1-cn(\frac{3\sqrt[4]{5}\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}z; 0.5(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}})))}{(5+\sqrt{5})-(5-\sqrt{5})cn(\frac{3\sqrt[4]{5}\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}z; 0.5(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}))}.
\end{equation}
As follows from \eqref{eq:sol}, the coupling coefficient \(\gamma\) and the phase mismatching between BW and SH (\(\Delta_{21}k\))  influence only on the intensity oscillation period: the TH maximal intensity remains the same  and equals \(0.8\).

\paragraph*{Domain $-1.5<q<3 + \frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{2}}-9\sqrt[3]{ 2}$: three real roots.} 
In this case all three roots $P_{3j}$ are positive. Therefore, there are two regimes of the waves interaction: low-efficient mode and high-efficient one. In low-efficient regime, the TH intensity changes between $0$ and $P_{31}$ as follows: \textcolor{red}{испраьте корни и тд}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p1_2}
\begin{aligned}
&p_1(z)=\frac{P_{31}P_{33}sn^2(7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\sqrt{P_{32}(P_{33}-P_{31})}z,k)}{P_{31}sn^2(7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k} \sqrt{(P_{32})(P_{33}-P_{31})}z,k)+(P_{33}-P_{31})},\\
&k=\sqrt{\frac{P_{31}(P_{33}-P_{32})}{P_{32}(P_{33}-P_{31})}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation} 
In high-efficient regime, the TH intensity changes between values of the roots $P_{32}$ and $P_{33}$ according to the rule:
\textcolor{red}{испраьте корни и тд}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p1_2bis}
\begin{aligned}
&p_1(z)=\frac{P_{32}P_{33}}{(P_{33}-P_{32})sn^2(7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\sqrt{P_{32}(P_{33}-P_{31})}z,k)+P_{32}},\\
&k=\sqrt{\frac{P_{31}(P_{33}-P_{32})}{P_{32}(P_{33}-P_{31})}}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\textcolor{red}{Напишите что-то о периоде и амплитуде.}
\paragraph*{The first special case $q=-1.5$: $0<P_{31}<P_{32}=P_{33}=1$.}
\textcolor{red}{испраьте корни и тд. Ничего непонятно.}
For this parameter value  $q$, the TH intensity $p_3(z)$  changes again between $0$ and $P_{31}=0.64$. However, the solution is expressed through the cosine function:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p1_3}
p_1(z)=\frac{P_{31}(1-\cos(6\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}z))}{-P_{31}\cos(6\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}z)+2-P_{31}}=\frac{8(1-\cos(6\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}z))}{-8\cos(6\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}z)+17}.
\end{equation}

\textcolor{red}{продолжите формулу, подставив Р31.}

\paragraph*{The second special case $q=3+\frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{2}}-9\sqrt[3]{2}$: $0<P_{31}=P_{32}<P_{33}<1$.}
In this case $q\approx-1.2$ , there are two regimes of the frequency conversion. In both of them (low-efficient and high-efficient), the TH intensity $p_3$ evolution is governed  by:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:p1_4}
\begin{aligned}
&z(p_3)=\frac{1}{7.5\frac{\gamma^2}{\Delta_{21}k}\sqrt{P_{31}(P_{33}-P_{31})}}\ln\frac{\left(\sqrt{(P_{33}-P_{31})p_3}+\sqrt{P_{31}(P_{33}-p_3)}\right)^2}{|p_3-P_{31}|P_{33}},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Analysis of \eqref{eq:p1_4} shows that the THG maximal efficiency is more than $95\%$ and this value is achieved at $q=?????$ as one can see in Fig.\ref{fr:cglp}.
\begin{figure}
    \centering

\caption{ИСПРАВЬТЕ ПАРАМЕТР НА рис.а УБЕРИТЕ B-D. Dependence of the TH maximal intensity on the parameter q }
\label{fr:cglp}
\end{figure}
Therefore, the phase matching between TH and FW is not the optimal condition for THG because at $\Delta_{31}k=0$ ($q=0$) only $80\%$ of the BW energy converts. Another conclusion following from Fig. \ref{fr:cglp} is that the TH maximal intensity is sufficiently lower for $|q|>>1$, i.e. at the same incident intensity the greater $|\Delta_{21}k|$, the smaller interval of $\Delta_{31}k$ provides the effective THG.

{Поставьте параметры расчетов здесь для рис. 3 b-d }
However, this results are obtained for the modified problem, so they must be verified by the computer simulation of the original problem, which we also present here. First of all, we show that the conversion efficiency of $80\%$ is indeed achieved at phase matching between TH and FW approximately in the section $z=15$ (Fig. \ref{fr:cglp}b \textcolor{red}{ Параметры)}, and we see a good coincidence between solutions of both problems. In contrast to this, the contradiction between two solutions is observed in Fig. \ref{fr:cglp}c \textcolor{red}{ Параметры)}) at theoretically best case $p=3+ \frac{9}{\sqrt[3]{2}}-9\sqrt[3]{2}$, and only $|A_3|^2=0.7$ is achieved. The reason is that this parameter value is a border between two different areas of intensity evolution (see Methods for more details), so in this case the tiny factors (of order $O(\Delta_{21}k^{-2})$ and lower), which were neglected at derivation of the modified problem, play more important role than in other cases. Fortunately, if we slightly shift the parameter $\Delta_{31}k$ towards zero ($\Delta_{31}k=-0.05$ for definiteness), than the THG efficiency sufficiently improves and achieves the value of $93\%$ (Fig. \ref{fr:cglp}d\textcolor{red}{ Параметры)} ).
}

\textcolor{ForestGreen}
{
Thus, we see that the phase matching is not necessary the best choice. It can be explained by analyzing of the set of the equations \eqref{eq:main2}. We see that the equation with respect to $W$ does not contain the self-modulation term $|W|^2W$, therefore, it is not symmetrical in contrast to the classical model of THG in a medium with cubic nonlinear response, so non-zero phase mismatching between FW and TH partly compensate FW self-modulation and cross-modulation between waves.
}

\textcolor{ForestGreen}{However, let us pay closer attention to the case $\Delta_{31}k=0$. Here we compare both analytical and numeric solutions of the modified problem with the numeric solution of the original problem. Следующие несколько предложений стоит убрать.}
\textcolor{blue}
{
To verify the solution \eqref{eq:sol} we compare it with the computer simulation results of the problem \eqref{eq:main2}. Since the equation set \eqref{eq:main2} was derived as approximate equations of the problem \eqref{eq:ref1}, so it is necessary to compare the solutions of both problems.} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Дальше -- нормально.} \textcolor{blue}{ Therefore, in Fig. \ref{fr:1}a we show three solution at \(\gamma=6\) and \(\Delta_{21}k=250\). We see that they coincide with each other until the section \(z=5\).
\begin{figure}[h!]

\label{fr:1}
\end{figure}
}

\textcolor{blue}{
Then there is a very little difference between the problem \eqref{eq:ref1} solution and two other solutions, which arises from the difference of the intensity oscillation period for the solutions of both problems. Therefore, the equation set \eqref{eq:main2} possesses a high approximation of the equation, and the formula \eqref{eq:sol} gives an analytical solution of this problem.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
As it follows from an analytical consideration, the TH intensity maximal value equals \(0.8\), and this value does not depend on the parameters \(\gamma\) and \(\Delta_{21}k\). To verify this, we depict in Fig. \ref{fr:1}b the computer simulation results for the parameters \(\gamma=4\) and \(\Delta_{21}k=100\). We see that the maximal intensity does not change (this statement is also confirmed by Fig.\ref{fr:1}c). Because the phase mismatching is lower than in the previous case (Fig. \ref{fr:1}c), then the difference between two numerical solutions obtained on the base of the original problem and of the modified (simplified) equations increases. In particular, the numerical solution of the problem \eqref{eq:main2} does not describe tiny oscillations, which are observed for the original problem solution (dashed line). Nevertheless, both approaches predict a high energy conversion efficiency for TH.
}

\textcolor{blue}{
To support that the intensity oscillations period depends on the parameter \(\gamma^2/\Delta_{21}k\) we multiply value of \(\gamma\) by \(2\), and \(\Delta_{21}k\) by \(4\) and depict the computer simulation results in Fig. \ref{fr:1}c. We see that the intensity oscillations periods in Figs. \ref{fr:1}b and \ref{fr:1}c are the same. However, with increasing of the phase mismatching, the approximation of the problem solution is better.

\textcolor{blue}
{
Thus, the developed analytical solution contains all features of the solution computed on the base of the equation set \eqref{eq:ref1}.

They show that the modified equations approximate the original ones with high precision, and, what is most important, that at least $50\%$ of the incident energy transfers to the third harmonic (TH) wave.

\section{Computer simulation of the frequency tripling.}
}
\textcolor{ForestGreen}
{
\subsection{SOD influence on the frequency tripling}
}
Below we discuss the computer simulation results for the frequency tripling of the optical pulses and at phase matching of THG (\(\Delta_{31}k=0\)), and taking into account the SOD influence, and the group velocity matching: \(\nu_{21}=\nu_{31}=0\). We provide a computer simulation using the set of equations \eqref{eq:ref1} and the set of equations \eqref{eq:main2}. Our aim is a demonstration of the high efficient THG with a smooth shape of a pulse at the trebled frequency and its smooth spectrum. 

The incident pulse at the FF possesses Gaussian distribution without any chirp:
\begin{equation}
A_{10}(t)=A_{01}e^{-(t-0.5L_t)^2},
\end{equation}
where \(A_{01}\) is equal to unity due to chosen dimensionless parameters. However, the parameter \(A_{01}\) will be used in the Conclusion of the paper for the final illustration of the frequency conversion efficiency dependence on the incident pulse intensity.

\textcolor{brown}{R2: Also, there are no indications regarding most of data in the figures.} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{У нас в тексте было (в начале 4 пункта) описание данных на графиках (что к чему относится). Нужно ли добавлять что-то ещё?}

It should be emphasized that below in paragraphs \ref{par:nor} and \ref{par:an} the solution of the problem \eqref{eq:ref1}-\eqref{eq:first} is depicted as a solid line while the solution of the modified problem  \eqref{eq:main2}-\eqref{eq:ini2} is shown as a dotted line.  Numbers \(1,\,2,\,3\) in the Figs. denote FW, SH, and TH, respectively. In some cases, we also demonstrate the applicability of the analytical solution derived in the long pulse duration approximation and this solution is depicted as a dashed line. We pay an attention to the pulses spectra and depict the initial spectrum distributions (as well as the FW initial pulse shape) in some Figs. via the solid line with triangles.

\subsection{Normal dispersion of a medium at FW wavelength}
\label{par:nor}
First of all, we consider the frequency tripling of the pulse with wavelength \(\lambda=800\,nm\) and propagating in a BBO crystal with the normal dispersion, which corresponds in our notations to negative values of the dimensionless SOD coefficients. In Fig. \ref{fr:c1_1}a-c the pulse shapes are depicted for the frequency upconversion at a relatively small phase mismatching between SH and FW (\(\Delta_{21}k=20\)) and at the incident pulse duration being about \(100fs\). It should be stressed that a positive sign of phase mismatching \(\Delta_{21}k\) corresponds to the FW pulse compression under its propagation in a medium with the normal SOD if the THG is not essential.

We see a good coincidence between the FW and TH pulse shapes, computed on using the original problem solution and the modified one, until the section \(z=13\). Despite a medium possesses only the quadratic nonlinearity (\(\alpha=0\)), the TH intensity is high: it achieves \(0.75\) dimensionless units at the pulse center. This growth accompanies by the spectral broadening of the FW and TH pulses in comparison with the incident FW pulse spectrum. However, the FW pulse spectrum has two local minimums in this section of a medium. 

After the distance equals 10 units (Fig. \ref{fr:c1_1}e), the FW intensity begins its growth. It happens due to the sub-pulses formation at the FF. Indeed, in the section \(z=7\) (Fig. \ref{fr:c1_1}a) the FW pulse shape is smooth, and it becomes close to plate distribution near the pulse center. After this section of a medium, the intensity grows in this part of the pulse (Fig. \ref{fr:c1_1}b), and its increasing becomes very remarkable (Fig. \ref{fr:c1_1}c). 

The conversion efficiency achieves \(51\%\) and, at the same time, the TH spectra (Fig. \ref{fr:c1_1}d)  has smooth shape without any local minima. We also want to note that the analytical solution perfectly describes the waves interaction until the section \(z=7.5\). Then we see that the FW pulse self-focusing and TH efficiency, predicted by the theory, are slightly higher than the corresponding values obtained from computer simulation results. Nevertheless, the equation \eqref{eq:main2} correctly describes a self-focusing of the pulses, as well as the presence of the effective cubic nonlinearity under waves interaction occurring at the cascading SHG.
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{Cascade1_1}  
\caption{Pulse shapes in the sections \(z=7\) (a), \(10\) (b), \(13\) (c), and FW and TH spectra in the section \(z=13\) (d), and pulse intensities evolution at their centers (e) and the frequency conversion efficiency evolution (f) along \(z\)-coordinate computed for the parameters $\gamma=1,\, \Delta_{21} k=20,\, D_1=-0.0032,\, D_2=-0.0083,\, D_3=-0.0199.$ } 
\label{fr:c1_1}
\end{figure}

If the sign of the phase mismatching between FW and SH is negative (\(\Delta_{21}k=-20\)), then the energy conversion from the FW to TH also occurs with high efficiency (Fig.\ref{fr:c1_2}). Nevertheless, there are new essential features, which accompanies this process. 
\begin{figure}[h!] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Cascade1_2}  
\caption{Pulse shapes (a), FW and TH spectra (b) in the section \(z=30\), and pulse intensities evolution at their centers (c) and the frequency conversion efficiency evolution (d) along \(z\)-coordinate computed for the parameters $\gamma=1,\, \Delta_{21} k=-20,\, D_1=-0.0032,\, D_2=-0.0083,\, D_3=-0.0199.$} 
\label{fr:c1_2}
\end{figure}
So, this sign of the phase mismatching corresponds to FW pulse decompression due to induced cubic nonlinear response in a medium with normal dispersion. Therefore, the pulse duration of the FW and TH is greater than those at the positive phase mismatching (compare Fig. \ref{fr:c1_2} and Fig.\ref{fr:c1_1}). However, despite the FW pulse decompression, the bandwidth of the TH pulse spectrum is greater than the FW incident pulse spectrum. It means that the essential spectral broadening of the TH pulse occurs and this pulse can be additionally compressed. Moreover, the energy conversion reaches the value of about \(60\%\) at increased crystal length in comparison with the previous case: the crystal length must be about \(3\,cm\). Other features of the THG process are similar to the generation process at the positive phase mismatching.

\subsection{Anomalous dispersion of a medium at FW wavelength}
\label{par:an}
Let us briefly discuss THG in a medium with the anomalous dispersion occurring at the frequency of FW. Therefore, the SOD coefficient \(D_1\) is positive. We consider a propagation of the incident pulse with duration about \(100fs\) and with wavelength about \(1064nm\) in KDP crystal (see, for instance, \cite{bib:ri}). If \(\Delta_{21}k>0\) that corresponds to decompression of the FW pulse and compression of the pulse at trebled frequency, then the efficiency of FW energy conversion to the TH achieves about \(60\%\) in the section \(z=15\) (Fig. \ref{fr:c1_11}) and it is accompanied with TH pulse good shape and its broadened spectrum in comparison with the incident pulse spectrum at the FF. We see that the FW pulse shape has three intensity maxima and possesses smaller intensity at the pulse center in comparison with its value occurring at the pulse propagation in a medium possessing the normal dispersion at the FF. Nevertheless, we can see in Fig. \ref{fr:c1_11} that the FW pulse spectrum is more broadened in comparison with the incident pulse spectrum.

\begin{figure}[h!] 
\centering 
\includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{Cascade1_11}  
\caption{Pulse shapes (a), and FW and TH spectra (b) in the section \(z=15\), and pulse intensities evolution at their center (c) and the frequency conversion efficiency evolution (d) along \(z\)-coordinate computed for the parameters  $\gamma=1,\, \Delta_{21} k=20,\, D_1=0.0006,\, D_2=-0.0035,\, D_3=-0.0062.$} 
\label{fr:c1_11}
\end{figure}

If the phase mismatching between FW and SH is negative (\(\Delta_{21}k<0\)), then the pulse compression at FF occurs, and decompression of the SH and TH pulses is observed. This leads to high-effective THG (Fig.\ref{fr:c1_12}): more than \(80\%\) of the FW energy converts to the TH wave! However, the TH intensity is less than its value at the positive phase mismatching \(\Delta_{21}k\), and the TH spectrum is smooth and broadened.

\section{Conclusion and remarks}


\textcolor{brown}{R1:Since the authors perform numerical simulations with short pulses, there are self- and cross-phase modulations and dispersion-induced effects, which complicate the frequency conversion phenomena. In order to clarify the basic properties, e.g., how the THG efficiency depends on the phase mismatch for SHG and that for SFG, the authors should perform numerical simulations with the continuous wave input or for the longer pulse input. After clarifying the fundamental properties, the authors may proceed to study the THG process with shorter pulses.}
\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Добавил расчёты в приближении длинных импульсов, а также зависимости от фазовых расстроек (пунет 3.3). Наверное, этого должно быть достаточно.}

\textcolor{brown}{R1:In page 3, lines 2-3, the authors describe as “the third (new) process of the frequency tripling is based on the frequency doupling at big mismatching.” However, it does not explain the mechanism of THG under large phase mismatching condition. The authors should give reasonable explanation on the mechanism. Why is THG generated under the large phase mismatching condition for SHG?} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{По поводу физического обоснования я пока ничего не добавлял. В статье ди Трапани, например, есть скорее описание: слагаемое $|A|^2A$ возникает из последовательного действия процессов генерации второй гармоники, за которым следует процесс генерации разностной частоты. Соответственно, в нашем случае вместо генерации разностной частоты генерация суммарной частоты. Если такого достаточно, то я могу это добавить.}


\textcolor{brown}{R1:The authors should compare the THG efficiency of the proposed scheme with that of the conventional scheme of phase-matched SHG followed by phase-matched SFG. The authors should also present the advantages of the proposed scheme compared with the conventional scheme. Is it true that the proposed scheme gives higher efficiency? If so, why is it?} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Вообще-то, у нас уже был небольшой обзор других подходов и описание наших преимуществ. В частности, основная работа – работа Крэкстона – по генерации в двух кристаллах есть. Максимальная возможная теоретическая эффективность в этой работе – $100\%$ (правда, по-видимому никогда не достигнутая), так что в этом вопросе мы даже несколько проигрываем (у нас около $93\%$). Так что если говорить о преимуществах нашего подхода, то это прежде всего простота. Нам не требуются два кристалла, или кристалл со сложной структурой, или дополнительные аксессуары, при этом обещанная эффективность высока.}




\textcolor{brown}{R1:The manuscript should be re-organized to focus on the principle and the basic properties of the proposed scheme. It is much more important to present them than to present complicated behaviors induced by self- and cross-phase modulations and dispersion-induced effects.}
\textcolor{ForestGreen}{До некоторой степени переделал, влияние дисперсии находится теперь в конце, но, вероятно, нужно править ещё.}


\textcolor{brown}{R1: The supplementary information contains so many numerical simulations which does not seem to be necessary to support the materials presented in the main manuscript} \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Пока не менял. Там, в частности есть результаты по модуляционной неустойчивости, которые с одной стороны вошли в новую статью, с другой стороны важны и для этой, поскольку связаны с эффективностью преобразования. Также есть результаты, которые не вошли в новую статью (поскольку относятся к ненулевым расстройкам групповых скоростей).
По поводу большого объёма, насколько я помню, мы собирались написать что-то вроде «мы считаем, что эти результаты важны, но можем их убрать отсюда».

We have proposed a new physical scheme of THG based on cascading SHG, which leads to an appearance of the induced cubic nonlinear response of a crystal possessing a quadratic susceptibility only. Thus, the frequency trebling is possible under the conditions corresponding to the frequency doubling of the laser pulse or beam. The generation process is not restricted by the incident pulse duration. A necessary length of a crystal, at which an efficient THG is observed, depends on the phase mismatching between the SH and FW and can be changed from 1.0 cm to 20 cm. 

Using multiscale method, we have derived the equations (named as modified equations) describing frequency trebling due to cascading SHG and showed that they contain the terms responsible for the cubic nonlinear response, which results in THG as well as FW self-modulation, and also FW and TH cross-modulation. Essentially, the equations do not contain the term responsible for the TH self-modulation that is very important for practice.A validity of the modified equations is confirmed by comparing of solutions of both sets of the Schr\"{o}dinger equations: original ones and modified ones. We developed an analytical solution of the modified equations in the framework of the long pulse duration approximation at using the derived integrals of motion. This solution allows us to estimate a maximal frequency conversion efficiency as well as its dependence on the parameters of interacting waves.

We have also investigated the influence of other parameters on the pulse interaction: SOD, and the phase mismatching between TH and FW, and GVM between both SH and FW as well as TH and FW.  We show that the high THG efficiency is achieved for both types of a medium: anomalous and normal dispersion at the FF. The GVM between SH and FW pulses influences only the pulse shapes without strong changing of the THG efficiency. In contrast, the GVM between TH and FW influences remarkably the frequency conversion process. To compensate this negative influence, we have proposed and discussed some physical schemes for three-waves interaction. Moreover, since only quadratic nonlinear effects are required for THG through the cascading SHG, it is possible to use longer pulses with duration of picoseconds or nanoseconds to decrease negative GVM and SOD influence. Another way is using of so-called "tilted pulses" \cite{bib:tilt1,bib:tilt2} to compensate SOD effects.

it is important for practice that the proposed technique for optical frequency conversion can be used for other frequency conversion problems, such as Fourth Harmonic Generation or even Fifth Harmonic Generation or wave with difference frequency.
